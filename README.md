### Hi there 👋, I'm Hubert Milewski

I am a **Front-end Developer** and **AI Automation Engineer** based in Poland. I have been exploring code for over 5 years and have 1 year of commercial experience delivering software solutions. My main focus is building modern web applications and integrating them with efficient AI workflows.

Currently, I work at **Hire AI**, where I am building an advanced **dashboard** and **AI agents**. Simultaneously, I am developing a custom management dashboard for an **acrobatics company** to streamline their operations.

My core stack revolves around the **React** ecosystem, specifically **Next.js** combined with **Supabase** for backend services. For AI automation tasks, I utilize **n8n**. 

I am also proficient in using **Git** for version control, deploying apps via **Vercel**, and I have a basic working knowledge of **Docker**.

If you want to chat about code or automation, the best way to reach me is via **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hubert-milewski-957585358/)**.
